# WCAG quick reference A failures

## Principle 1 – Perceivable

- Non-text content (images, colours, audio, video, visual descriptions) has no or unequivalent/incomplete alternatives.
- Non-text content plays for more than a few seconds, or can't be stopped.
- HTML is invalid, used semantically incorrectly; CSS is used for more than presentation.

## Principle 2 – Operable

- Some functionality is not available from a keyboard.
- Some functionality is moving / flashing / timed / auto-updating and can't be turned off, adjusted, or extended (unless it's very short / small).
- There are no ways to navigate like skip links, landmarks, or headings.
- The page title isn't clear, helpful, or unique.
- The order of things makes logical sense.
- A particular input modality (that's not keyboard or mouse) is required.

## Principle 3 – Understandable

- Language of the page is not set.
- Standard behaviours for focus and forms aren't followed.

## Principle 4 – Robust

- The HTML doesn't validate and custom controls don't have accessible Name, Role, Value.
