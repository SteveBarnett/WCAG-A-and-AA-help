# WCAG quick reference A failures

- Any non-text content (images, colours, audio, video, visual descriptions) has no or unequivalent/incomplete alternatives
- Any non-text content that changes without user interaction can't be turned off, adjusted, or extended (unless it's very short / small)
- Logical and standard order and behaviours aren't followed
- No helpful navigation exists: good page title, skip links, landmarks, or headings
- Some functionality is not available from a keyboard
- HTML is invalid, used semantically incorrectly, inaccessible
- CSS is used for more than presentation
